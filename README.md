This application is mainly used from the clients' side. Clients that wants to buy products that we are selling here are able to use this application I created to process the order.

These screenshots demenstrate clients will be asked which product they would like to purchase. After clients input the product they want into the app, the app will then ask the quantity of the product they wish to buy. At the end of the purchasing process if we have enough amount of products in stock we will update our stock list and print out the updated list. 

On the other hand, if we do not have enough amount of product in stock, we then let clients know that the product they demand is sold out already. 

Another thing is if clients wish to buy something we do not sell, we let them know that we do not sell the product they wish to buy.
